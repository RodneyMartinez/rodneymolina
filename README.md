### About me
Hi folks! ðŸ˜Ž
I am about to become a system engineer, yet I have been working
on the web for about fifteen years now. Before that, I worked as
graphic designer on Fiverr, where you can find me as @rodmarmol,
then I moved om Freelancer.com, there I used to work as Mograph,
and I started to do some personal pages for sale executives.
I have worked on many projects on multiplatforms CMSs such as:
Adobe AEM, WordPress, Salesforce and a little bit of HubSpot.
I love learning about tech and programing languages like for
example ReactJS, Boostrap, NodeJS, MomgoDB, Phyton and so on.
I â™¥...
...playing Fortnite,
...cooking,
...reading,
...socializing, and whatever make me be better every single day,
because after all, that's all we'vw got..., the present!
